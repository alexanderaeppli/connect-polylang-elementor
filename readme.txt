* MySQL version 5.0 or higher

= We Recommend Your Host Supports at least: =

* MySQL version 5.6 or higher / or MariaDB 10 or higher

= Installation =

1. Install using the WordPress built-in Plugin installer (via **Plugins > Add New** - search for `connect polylang elementor`), or extract the ZIP file and drop the contents in the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to **Elementor > My Templates**, choose a template, save its display conditions
4. Next time you set or edit display conditions in Elementor, the language conditions (via Polylang) should appear


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is the plugin's settings page? =
This plugin has NO settings page, as it does not need one. All it does works just under the hood. Activate the plugin. Done.

However, you need to save your template conditions in the Elementor Theme Builder (via Elementor Pro) once, so that the language conditions will show up next time you are editing those conditions. This 2-step usage is currently a technical limitation.


= More info on Translations? =

* English - default, always included
* German (de_DE): Deutsch - immer dabei! :-)
* For custom and update-safe language files please upload them to `/wp-content/languages/connect-polylang-elementor/` (just create this folder) - This enables you to use fully custom translations that won't be overridden on plugin updates. Also, complete custom English wording is possible with that as well, just use a language file like `connect-polylang-elementor-en_US.mo/.po` to achieve that (for creating one see the following tools).

*Note:* All my plugins are internationalized/ translateable by default. This is very important for all users worldwide. So please contribute your language to the plugin to make it even more useful. For translating and validating I recommend the awesome ["Poedit Editor"](https://www.poedit.net/), which works fine on Windows, macOS and Linux.
