Connect Polylang with Elementor - use language conditions in Elementor Pro Theme Builder.


## Description 


### What the Plugin Does 
* Elementor Templates will become translateable: the set conditions in *Elementor Pro Theme Builder* will now be applied also for templates in another (Polylang) language (happens under the hood)
* **Usage Example:**
 * Make a header template in Elementor, set display conditions, apply this to one language (English for example)
 * Make a second header template in Elementor, set NO display conditions for this one, but apply to another Polylang language (German for example), meaning to link those languages/templates in Polylang
 * Result: when viewing in frontend the proper English content appears with the English header template, translated content in German appears with the German header template
* No further settings needed for these Template tweaks - just works out of the box! All the heavy lifting happens under the hood.


### Plus: Even More Features
* **Native Elementor Widget**: Polylang Language Switcher Widget to easily built a nice language switcher menu and have more styling options for non-coders at hand
* **Elementor Finder integration**: Adds Polylang languages, admin settings links, plus support resources as quick jump links to the Elementor Finder feature (Elementor v2.3.0+)


### Further Plugin Info 
* More features might be added in the future.
* Community collaboration between Brad Johnson, David Decker and more code coming from the Elementor/Polylang community


### Translations 
* English (default, `en_US`) - always included
* German (`de_DE`) - always included
* German formal (`de_DE_formal`) - always included
* `.pot` file (`connect-polylang-elementor.pot`) for translators is also always included :)
* Easy plugin translation platform with GlotPress tool: [Translate "Connect Polylang Elementor"...](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/connect-polylang-elementor)

* [Elementor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/) and [Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/) plugins - free versions from WordPress.org Plugin Directory
* **PLUS:** *Elementor Pro* which is needed for Theme Building possibilities. This is a paid premium product by Elementor LTD, [available via elementor.com](https://toolbarextras.com/go/elementor-pro/)

### We Recommend Your Host Supports at least: 

* PHP version 7.0 or higher
* MySQL version 5.6 or higher / or MariaDB 10 or higher


### Installation 

1. Install using the WordPress built-in Plugin installer (via **Plugins > Add New** - search for `connect polylang elementor`), or extract the ZIP file and drop the contents in the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to **Elementor > My Templates**, choose a template, save its display conditions

## Frequently Asked Questions 


### Where is the plugin's settings page?

This plugin has NO settings page, as it does not need one. All it does works just under the hood. Activate the plugin. Done.

(If there will be settings needed in the future, we might add options in later plugin versions.)



### Any known limitations?

Yes, the default flags in Polylang are sized 16px wide and 11px high. This migt be sufficient for most use cases still but bigger image sizes are not possible without loss of quality.

Polylang has feature for custom flags. If integration is possible, we are considering supporting it in the language switcher widget in a future plugin version.



### More info on Translations? 

* English - default, always included
* German (de_DE): Deutsch - immer dabei! :-)
* For custom and update-safe language files please upload them to `/wp-content/languages/connect-polylang-elementor/` (just create this folder) - This enables you to use fully custom translations that won't be overridden on plugin updates. Also, complete custom English wording is possible with that as well, just use a language file like `connect-polylang-elementor-en_US.mo/.po` to achieve that (for creating one see the following tools).

**Easy WordPress.org plugin translation platform with GlotPress platform:** [**Translate "Connect Polylang Elementor"...**](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/connect-polylang-elementor)

*Note:* All my plugins are internationalized/ translateable by default. This is very important for all users worldwide. So please contribute your language to the plugin to make it even more useful. For translating and validating I recommend the awesome ["Poedit Editor"](https://www.poedit.net/), which works fine on Windows, macOS and Linux.
